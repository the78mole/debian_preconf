# Debian Preconfiguration Script
Scripts for configuring a fresh Debian installation a bit more convenient

## Notes

This script is mainly intended to be used in a XCP-NG virtual machine, but it can easily adjusted or extended to be used on other systems. It is developed on Debian 10 Buster running on a Debian 9 Stretch XOA template, but should run on every modern Debian.
